Add author (can have many books)

add quantity for books in separate table
add caterogy (can have many books)   

add orders logic


books should not repeat in author
when posting the book to author, both should be validated

Create, Update, and Delete endpoints for Authors and Books.

Add search functionality (e.g., by book title, author name, genre).

Implement sorting and filtering for books (e.g., by publication date, price, or rating).

Add rating for book
Add rating for author


Add user authentication (using Spring Security with JWT or OAuth2):


Differentiate between regular users and admin users (admins can create/update/delete books, regular users can browse and place orders).

For developing your book shop back-end project further, you can follow this roadmap to enhance functionality, scalability, and maintainability:
1. Extend CRUD Operations

    Author & Book:
        Add Create, Update, and Delete endpoints for Authors and Books.
        Implement pagination for the "Get All" endpoint to handle large datasets efficiently.
        Add search functionality (e.g., by book title, author name, genre).
        Implement sorting and filtering for books (e.g., by publication date, price, or rating).

    Order & OrderItem:
        Implement Create, Update, and Delete operations for Orders and OrderItems.
        Add validation (e.g., ensure OrderItems have valid quantities and prices).
        Create custom queries (e.g., retrieve orders by user, date range, or order status).

2. Authentication & Authorization

    Add user authentication (using Spring Security with JWT or OAuth2):
        Differentiate between regular users and admin users (admins can create/update/delete books, regular users can browse and place orders).
    Implement role-based authorization to restrict access to certain endpoints (e.g., only admins can delete a book).

3. Shopping Cart Functionality

    Implement a shopping cart where users can add books before placing an order.
        Design the cart as a separate entity or store it in session data.
        Allow users to view, update, and remove items from the cart.

4. Order Processing

    Build an order creation process:
        When a user checks out, create an Order entity and associate it with the corresponding OrderItems.
        Track the order status: pending, shipped, delivered, cancelled.
        Implement order validation (e.g., ensuring stock availability before placing an order).

5. Payment Integration

    Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to handle payment processing.
    Ensure secure transaction handling and payment status tracking (success, failure, etc.).

6. Inventory Management

    Create a system to manage book inventory.
        Deduct quantities from inventory when an order is placed.
        Send alerts or block orders if inventory is insufficient.

7. User Profiles and Order History

    Implement user profiles with order history:
        Each user can view their past orders, order details, and order statuses.
    Add functionality for order cancellations or returns.

8. Rating & Reviews System

    Allow users to rate and review books.
        Store ratings and reviews in the database.
        Implement review moderation for admin users.

9. Database Enhancements

    Improve your database schema:
        Consider using caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data (like books and authors).
        Optimize query performance for large datasets (using indexes, optimizing relationships, etc.).

10. Unit Testing and Integration Testing

    Write comprehensive unit tests for your service and repository layers.
    Add integration tests to ensure your APIs work as expected in various scenarios (successful calls, validation errors, etc.).

11. Deploy the Application

    Consider containerizing your application using Docker.
    Deploy the application on cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku for real-world usage.
    Add continuous integration (CI) pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for automated testing and deployment.

12. Documentation

    Write API documentation (using Swagger or OpenAPI) so others (or future you) can easily understand and consume the API.
    Document the overall architecture and explain core entities and relationships.

This roadmap covers functional improvements, security, performance, and deployment. Let me know if you’d like more details on any of these steps!
